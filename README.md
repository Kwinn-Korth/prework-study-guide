# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description 

I made this so I could learn the basics of coding and so I could get a feel of what I knew and what I needed to learn. It is designed to help bootcamp students keep track of what they know while reinforcing that knowledge with application. I learned while making this that I know very little, and there is a lot for me to learn.
